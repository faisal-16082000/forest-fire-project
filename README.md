# Forest Fire Area Predictor

This project predicts the burned area of forest fires using meteorological data and different regression models.

## Project Motivation

Forest fires cause severe environmental and economic damage worldwide. Predicting the fire area helps in planning resources and taking preventive actions.

## Dataset

The dataset contains meteorological features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and related data collected from Algerian forests along with the corresponding burned area.

## Models Used

Several regression techniques were explored to model and predict the fire area, including:

- Multiple Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Lasso Regression  
- Elastic Net Regression  

Among these, **Ridge Regression** gave the most reliable and stable results for this dataset.
